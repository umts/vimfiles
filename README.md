This repo is our baseline `~/.vim/` directory.  It uses [git submodules][gitsm]
and the (Vim 8+) native "pack" system to manage plugins. Many of the
configurations used in here are inspired by [Janus][janus].


Installation
============
```bash
$ curl -Lo- https://git.io/vgUw4 | bash
```

_or_

```bash
$ wget -O- https://git.io/vgUw4 | bash
```

_Or_, feel free to clone it yourself

```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/umts/vimfiles.git ~/.vim
```

and then sym-link to or source the `vimrc` and `gvimrc` files as you like.

Features
========
Oh so many plugins, here's a quick, and not quite complete, list.

*Note: below, when we refer to "`<Leader>`", we're referring to the vim
special key.  By default, that's a comma, but you can remap it to
some other key in `plugin/00-leader.vim`*

*   [Vim-ack][ack]

    Used to search through a project directory.  You can you can use `:Ack`,
    or, for your convenience, it's mapped to `<Leader>f`.  This plugin requires
    the ack program.  Install it with homebrew, apt-get, or whatever.

*   [Buffergator][buffg]

    Mapped to `<Leader>b`, this plugin gives you a list on the left of all
    of your currently open [buffers][buff]

*   [ctrl-P][ctrlp]

    Fuzzy find in project, buffers, or most-used files.  Press `<c-p>`
    to get started.

*   [Fugitive][fugitive]

    Awesome git integration.

*   [Flog][flog]

    Git log browser, mapped to `<Leader>g`.

*   [Gundo][gundo]

    Mapped to `<Leader>u`, this plugin will show you a nifty graphical
    representation of your undo tree.

*   [Indent-object][indent]

*   [NERDcommenter][nc]

    Tons of comment commands mapped to `<Leader>c<something>` (also in the
    plugin -> comment menu)

*   [NERDTree][nt]

    Mapped to `<Leader>n`, and also set to auto-appear when you call vim or
    mvim on a directory, this is a nice project tree type display

*   [Sessionman][sessman]

    Allows the saving and restoring of sessions.  It adds the options to
    the "File" menu, but there are also normal-mode commands.

*   [Supertab][st] tab-completion (`:h supertab`)

*   [Surround][surround]

    This plugin contains all sorts of commands for wrapping chunks of text
    in parentheses, etc.

*   [Syntastic][syntastic] syntax checker

*   [Tabular][tabular]

    This plugin is for making your text line up.  Maybe type `:Tab` and see
    what happens.

*   [Ultisnips][ultisnips] and [a collection of snippets][snippets]

*   [Zoomwin][zoom]

    Mapped to `<Leader><Leader>`, zooms into the current window, making it
    full-screen.

Customization
=============
"Local" Files
----------------------
You can use a `~/.vimrc.local` or `~/.gvimrc.local` file to add customizations
that are specific to a particular machine.

Credits
=======
The majority of the credit here goes to [Janus][janus].  The initial
inspiration was the old Rakefile-style Janus, but the git submodule
technique is borrowed from the new Janus.

Scrooloose's [vimfiles][slvf] repo also provided some hints on useful
plugins.

Steve Francia's [Vim distribution][spf-13] also provided some nice tips
for the `/.vimrc` file.
